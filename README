Problem Definition:
-------------------
Given a N X N grid with a random english language letter in each cell and
an english dictionary (englishwords.txt), write a program to generate all
valid words that can be found in the grid.

A valid word in grid should
 a. be present in englishwords.txt
 b. cells containing adjacent letters in the word should be neighbors.
 c. each cell can be used only once in the word.

Example:
-------

A 4 x 4 grid

   ---------------
  | A | A | Q | U |
   ---------------
  | I | D | F | U |
   ---------------
  | D | L | G | Y |
   ---------------
  | L | M | K | X |
   ---------------

Following words can be made from this grid:
ilk, guy, did, aid, qadi, glia, km, id, lid, ail, ufa, fad, ufd, ad, ml

These are valid words from englishwords.txt included in this directory.

Input format:
------------
input grid should be read from a file named grid.txt (sample included in this directory)
First line contains the number of rows and columns. Each following line has the elements
of the row.

For the example grid input grid.txt will contain

4 4
A A Q U
I D F U
D L G Y
L M K X

Output format:
-------------
The program should write output to stdout. First line should state the total number
of words found followed by one word per line in lexicographically sorted order.
For above example grid the output will look as follows -

20
ad
add
aid
ail
did
dill
fad
fail
glia
guy
id
ilk
ill
km
lid
ml
qadi
ufa
ufd
ugli

Submission Guidelines:
----------------------
Please send in your source code along and brief explanation of your solution.
Try to come up with the most efficient solution possible.
The code should be production level which means it should be properly commented and have unit tests. You should not use inefficient algorithms like recursion but should look for optimal data structures to minimize lookups if possible.
The solution should be able to scale linearly with input grid files of 10x10 or more.
